# "optimistic updated" - addToFavorites component
## "Optimistic updates" is a strategy where the user interface is updated before the server confirms the successful completion of a request. If the request fails, the changes are reverted. This approach improves system responsiveness and creates the impression of faster interaction.
## Let's add optimistic updates to a component that uses the addToFavorites action. Here are the main steps:
### Update the local state before the server-side change.
### Perform the request to the server.
### If the request is successful, keep the local update.
### If the request fails, revert to the previous state.
